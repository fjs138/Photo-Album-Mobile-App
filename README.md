<h1>This is a cross-platform, cloud-storage enabled, photo album mobile application.</h1>
<h2>The app leverages the robust <b>Cordova</b> API collection, providing abstraction of phone functions.
Using a <i>single <b>JavaScript</b> codebase</i>, this application can be deployed on <b>Android, iOS, and Windows Phone</b>.</h2>

<h3><br>The development platform used to create this was the awesome Telerik AppBuilder.
I would definitely consider the use of this platform again to create a multiplatform mobile application, depending on my requirements.</h3>
